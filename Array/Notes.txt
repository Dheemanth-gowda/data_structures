->Array are cache friendly
->There are two type of array depending on the array memory allocation:
    1. Dynamically allocation   -> Allocation -> heap Memory
    2. Fixed Size Memory allocation -> Allocation -> Stac Memory

In java the array memory allocation is always in terms of heap memory allocation.

Dynamic Sized Array are of two types:
    1.C++       ->      Vector
    2.Java      ->      ArrayList
    3.Python    ->      Lists

Vector advantages:
    1. Dynamic Size
    2. Inbuilt rich Library
    3. Easy to know the Size
    4. No need to pass the Size
    5. Can be returned from the function
    6. Vector there is a default value allocation-> For example it saves the time of initializing every value of array elements to zero
        For int  -> Value is 0
        For Bool -> Value if false
    7. We can also copy one Vector to another Vector (//in case of array we will have to run a loop)
        v1 =  v2 is valid.
